- Predicting how modern scientific knowledge relates to ancient wisdom.
- Bridging the gap between traditional and contemporary knowledge systems.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Bodhini utilizes advanced NLP techniques to parse and understand both modern scientific literature and ancient scriptures.

- **Linking Insights**: It connects concepts from ancient texts to relevant scientific findings, providing users with a deeper understanding of both domains.

- **Prediction**: Bodhini can predict potential connections or insights by analyzing the context within ancient scriptures and cross-referencing them with contemporary scientific research.

- **Personalization**: The model can be tailored to specific areas of interest, making it a valuable tool for scholars, researchers, and enthusiasts in various fields.
